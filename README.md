A special thank you to Justin Hammerly for helping Eric and I get started with the calculate score method. 

Another special thank you to Domaine Scully. He showed us that using a for loop to iterate over the tuple is a great route for passing the rest of the tests. I previously tried mimicking the syntax that I used for 3 pairs and making slight adjustments but I wasn't successful.

A special thank you to Tammy Do. This lab has been very challenging
and she helped me debug and get used to moving step-by-step through 
the code. She helped me refactor a bit and work on banking the points.
It was a very informative experience and defintiely will help me
become a better dev. Not to mention, she got me into the habit of
using print() and testing the game more to better debug/refactor.
