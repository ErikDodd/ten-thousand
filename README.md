### Attributions:

Lab 06:

A special thank you to Justin Hammerly for helping Eric and I get started with the calculate score method. 

Another special thank you to Domaine Scully. He showed us that using a for loop to iterate over the tuple is a great route for passing the rest of the tests. I previously tried mimicking the syntax that I used for 3 pairs and making slight adjustments but I wasn't successful.
